1.  By choosing Q = eye(2), R = 1,Then the cost function is on the form of Vii-, and
¨   the NLP problem is stated. The next tasks becomes to introduce on-policy algorithm 
    for estimation of primariyl f. 

2.  If estimation of f alone does not work, consider adding base cost V0 to obj

3.  Start estimation of model parameters.
